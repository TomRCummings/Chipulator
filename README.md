# Chipulator
My attempt at making a Chip-8 emulator/interpreter! Comes with some snazzy tools and options including a memory viewer,
speed controls, and graphics & sound changer. Uses SDL for drawing pixels and generating sound; wxWidgets for UI and eventhandling;
and Boost for a little bit of logging.
